		Antipicating applied mathematics graduate pursuing a career in the software
		engineering industry for January 2018. Proficient in developing algorithms
		and manipulating models in Matlab, Python, and Java. Update the back-end of
		a software plug-in and design a couple websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
		Self-starter, team player, and problem solver.

		 <!-- I write algorithms by applying data science techniques and libraries, and most recently, I have been writing a methods to compare proteins that live
		 in the same family by creating a database, storing the results from my program, and exporting the organized data back into the program.  Then principal
		 components analysis will be implemented onto that data to determine the source of the greatest variances in the results.
		 This plug-in determines the function of a protein based on its catalytic sites, or motifs.  I have updated the motif files using principal components
		 analysis and a parsing method.  I also wrote a search algorithm using data science techniques and libraries; ProMOL will now have its own searching
		 process and hopefully, a better time complexity. -->


    <!-- <section id="main_content">
        <p>I started at Rochester Institute of Technology as a physics major, but two and	a half years later, I realized that it was the wrong field for
					me, but rediscovered a passion I have had since elementary school: <em>math</em>. I switched to applied mathematics in 2015, I took a few
					mathematical modeling courses, and my	opinion on programming changed. I began to love it.  Ever since, I try to learn as many languages as I can.
					I am always eager	to learn more about computer science, numerical analysis, databases, model building, algorithms, and software engineering.  By the
					end of Decemeber of 2016,	I joined a biochemical research team to incorporate my mathematical knowledge to their plug-in.  My work has introduced me
					to data science, and I have decided that this is the	career for me.  I realized that I want to develop and write algorithms, create and manage	databases,
					learn about	unfamiliar fields such as biochemistry, apply machine learning concepts to software, and program in the industry.</p>  -->

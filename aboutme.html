<article>


    <section id="intro">
	<p>I am a python developer, a manager, and an aspiring numerical mathematician. I graduate
	Rochester Institute of Technology with a bachelor of science in applied mathematics.  I am
	a member of the Structural Biology Extensible Visualization Scripting Language research team.
	I write machine learning concepts such as k-nearest neighbors and principal components
	analysis in efforts to update their plug-in into a stand-alone software.  I am a manager at
	a coffee shop on campus since January of 2016.  Math and programming are my passions, and I
	want to explore various fields throoughout my career such as data science, IT, software
	engineering, robotics, research, game design, and web and app development.</p>

    <section id="main_content">
        <p>I started at Rochester Institute of Technology as a physics major, but two and
	a half years late, I realized that it was the wrong field for me.  However, it
	helped me rediscover a passion I have had since elementary school: <em>math</em>.
	I had a couple friends in the math department, and they seemed well pleased with
	their studies, so I switched to applied mathematics in 2015. I took a few mathematical
	modeling courses, and my opinion on programming changed; I went from hating
	coding to loving it.  Ever since, I try to learn as many languages as I can. I am
	always eager to learn more about computer science, numerical analysis, databases,
	model building, algorithms, and software engineering.  By the end of Decemeber of 2016,
	I joined a biochemical research team to incorporate my mathematical knowledge to their
	plug-in.  My work has introduced me to data science, and I have decided that this is the
	career for me.  I realized that I want to develop and write algorithms, create and manage
	databases, learn about unfamiliar fields such as biochemistry, apply machine learning
	concepts to software, and program in the industry.</p>
